# Problem Statement
This project aims to address the concerns surrounding favorable and unfavorable retirement destinations, assisting individuals in making informed choices for their retirement locations, considering a variety of influencing factors.

-------------
# Objective
- To determine the **Best** and **worst** States to retire in 2023.
- To also analyze how the categories are assigned to each state.
- To examine how states compare in various retirement categories.


---------------
# Skills Demonstrated
I used Power BI to create the dashboard, and I also cleaned and organized the data using Power Query Editor before creating the visualizations.

------------------------
# Data Sourcing / Gathering
I gathered the data by extracting it from the internet and obtained another portion of the dataset in CSV format from the website.
However, the main data which was downloaded from the website contains 50 rows and 7 columnns.


-----------------
# Data Transformation / Cleaning
The data transformation and cleaning process involved utilizing the Power Query Editor for efficient cleansing. I also extracted category-assigned data points from the web, which I subsequently placed into an Excel file before importing them into Power BI. 

Screenshot is provided below.
